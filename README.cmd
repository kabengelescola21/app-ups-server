The UPS Server app is powered by the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project providing support for Power Devices
The UPS output should be regulated, and its either going to be at the specified/configured voltage,
or at 0. It shouldn't run at a lower voltage (other than 0), no matter how low the batteries get.
If the UPS runs out of power before the sleep time expires... it just turns off.
